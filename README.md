# Source Code
program simple_token_cd16a6o.aleo;

record Token:
    owner as address.private;
    amount as u64.private;

function mint:
    input r0 as address.private;
    input r1 as u64.private;
    cast r0 r1 into r2 as Token.record;
    output r2 as Token.record;

function transfer:
    input r0 as Token.record;
    input r1 as address.private;
    input r2 as u64.private;
    sub r0.amount r2 into r3;
    cast r0.owner r3 into r4 as Token.record;
    cast r1 r2 into r5 as Token.record;
    output r4 as Token.record;
    output r5 as Token.record;

}    
I was able to build my main.aleo from the simple token file,then i copied the code, changed the private key to my own private key in the environment and then entered the terminal in the playground and i ran this code format > leo run

combine_hash_owner_receiver <type_your_address>

<type_friend_address> deployed successfully in my demo.leo.app/display
